# Heart Disease Predictor

## Overview
The Heart Disease Predictor is a machine learning-based project designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various clinical and lifestyle-related parameters. This project aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to estimate the risk of heart disease.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Analyzes key factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to input data and receive predictions through an interactive interface.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**: Ensures accurate and robust model performance by handling missing data, scaling, and feature selection.

## Technologies Used
### Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting

### Programming Languages
- Python

### Libraries and Frameworks
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset containing patient health records, including attributes such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise-Induced Angina

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.

## Model Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing or inconsistent data.
   - Scale and normalize features for optimal model performance.
   - Encode categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identify and select key predictors using correlation analysis and domain knowledge.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**:
   - Train multiple machine learning models.
   - Evaluate performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Prediction**:
   - Input user data to predict the likelihood of heart disease.

## How to Use
1. Launch the application.
2. Enter patient data into the input fields.
3. View the prediction and associated probability score.

## Applications
- **Clinical Support**: Assists doctors in identifying at-risk patients.
- **Preventive Healthcare**: Helps individuals monitor their heart health.
- **Research**: Provides insights into factors contributing to heart disease.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate additional health metrics for more comprehensive predictions.
- Enable real-time predictions through wearable health devices.
- Implement explainable AI techniques to provide insights into model decisions.
